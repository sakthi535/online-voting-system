                <h1>An implementation of voting system enforced by facial recognition as two factor authentication</h1>
                <p>Utilize biometric facial recognition using image processing for enhancing vulnerabilities present in electronic voting system. The application developed will map voter with a unique id generated by image processing, which will be used as multi-factor authentication for electronic voting system.  </p>
